# craigslist-clone

This is a clone of the popular site craigslist. The app has the ability to create a new user and login. The user is then taken to a home page where it has a list of all the listings they've posted. A user can then navigate to the main listings page. They can browse the listings underneath the subcategories (food/bev/hosp and medical/health do not have templates yet but the others work fine). A user can also post a new listing.
