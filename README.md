# craigslist-clone

A user has the ability to look at listings underneath subcategories. At this time, the categories do not have functions other than labels. That will be added later.

When a user logs in, they will be taken to their home page. The home page, ideally, would have a list to all that user's listings. Right now, only some of the users I tried show links and they are not the links they posted. That needs to be fixed. Also on  the user's home page, is a button that will take them to the main page. The main page has all the listings underneath their subcategories.

At this time, only the subcategories under 'community' and 'for sale' are links. They direct the user to a page of listings but those listings are not yet links to show detail.

A user can make a new listing but only if the admin gives them permission. Still figuring out how to automatically gives new users basic permissions. But once admin gives the permission, a user can make a posting and add an image. Since I haven't gotten listing details to work yet, not sure if the image will show but so far it looks right. The image showed on github when I pushed the changes.

There a lot of bugs that need to be fixed and a lot of functionality that needs to be added. Work in progress.

# Project Title

This is a clone of the popular site craigslist. The app has the ability to create a new user and login. The user is then taken to a home page where it has a list of all the listings they've posted. A user can then navigate to the main listings page. They can browse the listings underneath the subcategories (food/bev/hosp and medical/health do not have templates yet but the others work fine). A user can also post a new listing.
